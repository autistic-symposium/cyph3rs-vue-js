# Neon HTML

HTML landing page template designed by Cruip.

This HTML template is shipped with the (Tailwind CLI tool)[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation].

* [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started

* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package.json`. You just need to run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.
* When `npm` has finished with the install, run `npm run build` to recompile the `style.css` file in the root directory.

You're ready to go! The most useful task for rapid development is `npm run dev`, which rebuild the CSS every time you make a change in the HML or JS files.
